SXMac is a light, notes like app that can be used as a rich text editor, markdown editor and preview, code editor with more than 100 supported languages. If you need specific files or anything else in one place. 

SXMac can be used as a note taking app with simple and clear interface that is doing its job.
The main focus is to bhe able to previed .md files and dynamicly see changes in your editor.
Not just that, but file export, easy import of files and centrilzied experience.

However not being somehting well defined it serves a purpose!


## Unity

SXMac leaves what you need to quickly see a file or even start editing it. You can easily drop it to the documents folder in order for it to be recognized or use a file picker box.
